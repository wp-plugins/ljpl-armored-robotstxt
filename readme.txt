Add some directives to your robots.txt file to keep your site safer

== Description ==

`robots.txt` is a file, which tell's search engines, which parts of your site it can display publicly. 
This plugin add's some entries to this file, to make your site safer from some attacks, keeping all your stength in seo intact ex. allowing search engine robots to harvest pictures for image search. When preparing a new site in Wordpress, it's one of the first plugins I install.

== Installation ==

Simple and straightforward.

1. Upload a file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've found a bug =

Great, let me now by mail or comment. I'll look into it for sure

= Can't I just create e robots.txt file? =

I suppose you can. But the plugin is better:
* Set it and forget it - if there's an update, you'll know
* Instaling a plugin is simpler than manualy creating and uploading a file
* Most importantly - creating a `robots.txt` file manualy turns all Wordpress filters for robots.txt off. It may (and most probably will) practicaly turn off your sitemap generator! (it will not be able to write it's directives to the `robots.txt` file
